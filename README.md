Description:
This project simulates an Internet of Things (IoT) based air quality monitoring system that measures PM2.5 (particulate matter) and CO2 levels using potentiometers (in place of actual sensors). The data is read using an Arduino Uno and is displayed on the Serial Monitor. The aim is to monitor air quality in real time and lay the groundwork for sending data to the cloud or a mobile app.
This is a prototype for real-world applications where actual gas/air sensors would be used.

Features:
1. Simulated Air Quality Measurement
PM2.5 and CO2 levels are simulated using two potentiometers.
Potentiometer knobs mimic changes in air pollution values.
2. Real-Time Data Monitoring
Values are continuously read via analog pins (A0 and A1).
Output is shown live in the Serial Monitor (like a basic dashboard).
3. Data Interpretation
Raw analog readings are mapped to real-world units:
PM2.5 in µg/m³
CO2 in ppm
4. User-Friendly & Affordable Prototype
Uses readily available and low-cost components.
Easy to simulate without physical sensors (perfect for learning and prototyping).
