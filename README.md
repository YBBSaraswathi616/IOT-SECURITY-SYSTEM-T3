Description:
  The IoT-based security system is designed to detect unauthorized access, send alerts, and optionally take action (like turning on a buzzer or camera). This smart system uses sensors such as PIR motion detectors, door contact switches, and optionally a camera or sound sensor.
When motion or an intrusion is detected:
It triggers an alarm
Sends a notification via the cloud (using Blynk, IFTTT, or Telegram)
Logs the event or captures an image (optional)
This system can be simulated in Tinkercad (without IoT features) and implemented in real hardware using ESP32/ESP8266.

Features:
1. Motion Detection
Uses a PIR sensor to detect movement in a room.
Works for both day and night.
2. Intrusion Alert
When motion is detected, a buzzer sounds and LED blinks.
Can send real-time alerts via mobile notifications (if cloud-connected).
3. IoT Connectivity (Advanced Version)
Use ESP8266 or ESP32 to connect with:
Blynk app
Telegram bot
ThingSpeak or Firebase
Sends messages like: “Motion detected at 3:20 PM!”
4. Arming & Disarming the System
Optional feature: control system using a smartphone app, RFID tag, or keypad.
5. Event Logging (Advanced)
Stores data like time, date, and duration of motion.
Useful for reviewing security events.
